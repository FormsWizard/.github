Welcome to **FormsWizard** — The survey tool for collaborative collecting and processing of structured data.

The project focuses on:
* privacy & security (all data is end-to-end encrypted)
* real time collaboration and offline functionality

Let's give it a try on our [**`Demo Instance`**](https://formswizard.winzlieb.eu/new.html)

The Software consists of 3 components:
1. The [forms-designer](https://github.com/FormsWizard/forms-designer) — A NoCode tool to create forms with a what-you-see-is-what-you-get drag&drop-editor.
2. The [survey component](https://github.com/FormsWizard/formswizard/tree/main/frontend/packages/submit) — Based on [JSONForms](https://jsonforms.io/).
3. The collaborative [processing](https://github.com/FormsWizard/processing) tool for inspecting and editing of collected datasets.
